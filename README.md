# Advent of Code

This project will contain all my solutions to Advent of Code problems from every year. I decided to make a project with all my Advent of Code years so they could all be in one place, and so I could run each of them easier.

- Use `dotnet run` to solve the current days puzzle
- Use `dotnet run -year -day` to solve a specific puzzle from a past date
- Use `dotnet run create -year -day` to create a folder and `Solution.cs` file

I modeled this project based off another one that I saw on GitHub.
