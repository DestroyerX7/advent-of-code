# Advent of Code

This project will contain all my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles from every year. I decided to make a project with all my Advent of Code years so they could all be in one place, and so I could run each of them easier.

- Use `dotnet run` to solve the current days puzzle
- Use `dotnet run -year -day` to solve a specific days puzzle (e.g `dotnet run 2025 08`)
- Use `dotnet run create -year -day` to create a folder and `Solution.cs` file (e.g `dotnet run create 2025 09`)
- Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your AoC session, so the program can automatically get your input when you run the create command (e.g `ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION=0123456789`)

I modeled this project based off another one that I saw on GitHub.
